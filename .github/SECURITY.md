# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities should **not** be reported as an issue on github because anyone can see this issue and use it.

On the other hand, Security vulnerabilities should be reported **as fast as possible**.

Instead, they should be as a private message on Discord to user `dan1st#7327` or `Gehasstes#0001`.

Private Messages are only allowed if the both users are member of a common server (Guild).
In order to bypass that you can join [this Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/KjMsK5G)
